## Introduction
``VLConstraintBasedModelGenerationUtlities.jl`` is a [Julia](https://julialang.org/downloads/) package holding constraint based model generation utility type functions and types. 

## Installation and requirements
``VLConstraintBasedModelGenerationUtlities.jl`` is organized as a [Julia](http://julialang.org) package which can be installed in the ``package mode`` of Julia.

Start of the [Julia REPL](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/REPL/index.html) and enter the ``package mode`` using the ``]`` key (to get back press the ``backspace`` or ``^C`` keys). Then, at the prompt enter:
