## Introduction
``VLConstraintBasedModelGenerationUtlities.jl`` is a [Julia](https://julialang.org/downloads/) package holding constraint based model generation utility functions and types. 

## Installation and requirements
``VLConstraintBasedModelGenerationUtlities.jl`` is organized as a [Julia](http://julialang.org) package which can be installed in the ``package mode`` of Julia.

Start of the [Julia REPL](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/REPL/index.html) and enter the ``package mode`` using the ``]`` key (to get back press the ``backspace`` or ``^C`` keys). Then, at the prompt enter:

    (v1.1) pkg> add VLConstraintBasedModelGenerationUtlities

This will install the ``VLConstraintBasedModelGenerationUtlities.jl`` package and the other required packages. ``VLConstraintBasedModelGenerationUtlities.jl`` requires Julia 1.6.x and above.
``VLConstraintBasedModelGenerationUtlities.jl`` is open source. You can download this repository as a zip file, or clone or pull it by using the command (from the command-line):

	$ git pull https://github.com/varnerlab/VLConstraintBasedModelGenerationUtlities.jl.git
